# Day 2: Request-Response

## Agenda

## Learning Objectives

## Tutorial Review (30 Minutes)

Submit your Tutorial Part 1 using [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).

Review the first portion of the Django tutorial together.

As we review, be sure to compare/contrast Django syntax with what you've seen before in Flask.

### Practice - I Do, We Do, You Do

Close your laptops and watch as the instructor starts a new project using the techniques from the tutorial.

Then, tell the instructor what to do to accomplish the same task.

On your own, complete the following:

1. Create a project called 'music_site' that contains an app called 'music'.
1. Re-route _all_ web requests (hint: use the empty string `''`) to your music app's URLs file. Then, send any web requests for the homepage `''` to a view called `home`.
1. Create a view function `home` that returns an HttpResponse with the text "Hello World! You're at the Music App home page."
