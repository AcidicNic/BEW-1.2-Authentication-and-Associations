## 🏁 [15m] Initial Exercise

### Contractor Project Proposal Review

Create [random groups] of 2-3 and ask students to review one another's proposals, which were due at the start of class today.

**Give feedback on:**

- Does the proposal **make sense**?
- What is **most effective** about the proposal?
- What points in the proposal could benefit from **improvement or further consideration**?

## 📖 [25m] Live Coding Demo

1. Ask students to close their laptops for this portion of class.
2. Live code the solution for the Pizza API challenge delivered on Day 5. Pull up the relevant documentation links and walk through each section of the code as you write it, pausing frequently for questions.
3. Add, commit, and push the code during break.
4. Message students in Slack with the repo link.

## 💻 [15m] In Class Activity I

- Brainstorm how to test the Pizza API.

## 🌴 [10m] BREAK

## 📖 [20m] Overview: Testing in Django

Go through the documentation regarding [Writing and Running Tests in Django].

## 💻 [30m] In Class Activity II

Break into [random groups] of 2-3.

**Challenge**: Use this [Intro to Testing in Django] tutorial to dive into testing!

**Stretch Challenge**: If you finish early, try writing tests for your Pizza models using this guide to [Testing APIs with Django REST Framework]. Use a fresh clone of the [makepizza] project to get started.
