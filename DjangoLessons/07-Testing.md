### Contractor Project Proposal Review

[Create random groups] of 2-3 and ask students to review one another's proposals, which were due at the start of class today.

**Give feedback on:**

- Does the proposal **make sense**?
- What is **most effective** about the proposal?
- What points in the proposal could benefit from **improvement or further consideration**?

## 📖 [20m] Live Coding Demo

1. Ask students to close their laptops for this portion of class.
2. Live code the solution for the Pizza API challenge delivered on Day 5. Pull up the relevant documentation links and walk through each section of the code as you write it, pausing frequently for questions.
3. Add, commit, and push the code during break.
4. Message students in Slack with the repo link.
