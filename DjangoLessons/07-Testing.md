## 🏆 [5m] Learning Objectives

1. Discuss, review, and revise Django Contractor Project proposals.
2. Describe the process involved when writing test cases using the Django framework.
3. Recognize which unit tests add value to a Django codebase.
4. Practice identifying and writing test cases in Django apps.
5. Integrate newly written test cases with existing code.

## 🏁 [10m] Initial Exercise

### Contractor Project Proposal Review

Create [random groups] of 2-3 and ask students to review one another's proposals, which were due at the start of class today.

**Give feedback on:**

- Does the proposal **make sense**?
- What is **most effective** about the proposal?
- What points in the proposal could benefit from **improvement or further consideration**?

## 📖 [30m] Live Coding Demo

1. Ask students to close their laptops for this portion of class.
2. Live code the solution for the Pizza API challenge delivered on Day 5. Pull up the relevant documentation links and walk through each section of the code as you write it, pausing frequently for questions.
3. Add, commit, and push the code during break.
4. Message students in Slack with the repo link.

## 💻 [10m] In Class Activity I

### Brainstorming Test Cases

Recall the **two typical types of tests** developers write:

- **Unit Tests** are isolated tests that test one specific function.
- **Integration Tests**, meanwhile, are larger tests that focus on user behavior and testing entire applications. Integration testing combines different pieces of code functionality to make sure they behave correctly.

Break into [random groups] of 2-3.

**Write down all the different test cases you'd create for the Polls app used in the Django tutorial.**

## 🌴 [10m] BREAK

## 📖 [20m] Overview: Testing in Django

Go through the documentation regarding [Writing and Running Tests in Django].

## 💻 [35m] In Class Activity II

### Dive into the Code

Break into [random groups] of 2-3.

* **Challenge**: Use this [Intro to Testing in Django] tutorial to dive into testing!
* **Stretch Challenge**: If you finish early, try writing tests for your Pizza models using this guide to [Testing APIs with Django REST Framework]. Use a fresh clone of the [makepizza] project to get started.
