#### How to Demonstrate Knowledge

### Outcome 2

Gain familiarity with an opinionated web framework by developing in Ruby on Rails and comparing and contrasting common patterns for backend web development.

#### How We Learned This

* Each day of class, we examined Ruby and Rails from the Python/Flask perspective, as well as the Node/Express perspective.

#### How to Demonstrate Knowledge

* We built 5+ projects in Rails over the course of the term!

In Step 2 of the XX Tutorial we built a YY.  This is one example of a data structure.
On Day UU we diagramed hash tables in class.
Key components of this outcome [Optional - may be covered in ways we learned section]
How to create, append a linked list.
Ways you can demonstrate your skill / knowledge level of this outcome
Write a code snippet to append an item to a linked list.
