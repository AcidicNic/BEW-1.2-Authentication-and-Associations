## Initial Exercise

### Koans = First Ruby TDD Experience (10 Minutes)

Continue working on your Koans. I'm offering a small but unique prize for all students who reach the path to enlightenment in class. Just update the [tracker](https://make.sc/trackbew1.3) accordingly!

## Overview/TT I

### So Many Gems, So Little Time (10 Minutes)

- Testing in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem can be confusing. What gem do you use to accomplish a TDD workflow in Rails? If you search around, you'll find lots of gems that handle testing suites... with so many available options, how can a new Rails developer implement a TDD workflow quickly and painlessly? `cucumber`? `rspec`? Good old fashioned `Test::Unit` perhaps?

Not sure what any of those terms reference? Let's investigate together in the following activity.

## In Class Activity I

### Exploring Efficient Package Evaluation (20 Minutes)

1. Split the class into **three groups**.
1. Assign each group a Ruby / Rails based **testing package to explore**:
    - `RSpec`
    - `Test::Unit`
    - `Cucumber`
1. **Evaluate your assigned package** together as a team!
    - To facilitate **quick evaluation** of a product as a developer, **focus on the following strategies**:
        - What are the _downsides_ to choosing this package?
        - How will this choice _affect my workflow_? My _team's_ workflow?
        - Will you have to _learn something new in order to use it_?
        - Find the open source code. _Is the implementation simple? Or does it look complex?_
