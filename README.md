## Course Description

In this course, students will learn to develop and release standardized server-side applications. Techniques include favoring convention over configuration, following a strict RESTful MVC architecture, and emphasizing the role of automated testing.

This course begins by fostering familiarity with syntactic language features, then rapidly moves into building server-side web applications and APIs. Deliverables include at least two completed and deployed applications.

## Prerequisites:

* [BEW 1.1](https://make.sc/bew1-1)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Use an open-source programming language.
1. Compare and contrast common patterns for backend web development.
1. Design, implement, and deploy multiple web applications through an opinionated web framework.
1. Build SQL-based Object Relationships Manager (ORM) patterns and queries.
1. Practice automated testing paradigms.
