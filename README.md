## Course Description

In this course, students will learn to develop and release standardized server-side applications. Techniques include favoring convention over configuration, following a strict RESTful MVC architecture, and emphasizing the role of automated testing.

This course begins by fostering familiarity with syntactic language features, then rapidly moves into building server-side web applications and APIs. Deliverables include at least two completed and deployed applications.

## Course Specifics

Weeks to Completion: 7 <br>
Total Seat Hours: 37.5 hours <br>
Total Out-of-Class Hours: 75 hours <br>
Total Hours: 112.5 hours <br>
Units: 3 units <br>
Delivery Method: Residential <br>
Class Sessions: 14 classes, 7 labs

## Prerequisites:

* [BEW 1.1](https://make.sc/bew1-1)
* [BEW 1.2](https://make.sc/bew1-2)

## Learning Objectives

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Establish comfort and demonstrative ability in the Ruby language.
1. Gain familiarity with an opinionated web framework by developing in Ruby on Rails and comparing and contrasting common patterns for backend web development.
1. Design, implement, and deploy multiple Rails applications.
1. Master SQL-based Object Relationships Manager (ORM) patterns and queries.
1. Continue growth and mastery of automated testing paradigms.

## Class Assignments

### Tutorials

Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  They are graded on completion only.

* [**REQUIRED**] [Ruby on Rails Guides Tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

### Projects

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
